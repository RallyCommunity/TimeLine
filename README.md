TimeLine
=========================

## Overview

View a time line with arbitrary start dates and end dates, allow zoom in. Will show all items regardless of whether start/end dates are completed.

Shows the Releases, Iterations and Calendar periods on top bar if requested. Light blue sections means that there are none defined for that time period.

Group by parent gives colour coded boxes on left with the children lumped together. Red triangle indicates errors in data.

Colour bars are RAG status based on algorithm in the Agile Central manual pages, grey bars are planned dates if present. Hover over bars for the dates. Percentages can be based on story count or story points.
